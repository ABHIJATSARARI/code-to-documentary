## 🎮 How to Use

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **🎭 Select Narrative Style**
   - Choose from 5 unique personas (Nature Doc, Senior Dev, Tech Evangelist, Noir Detective, Epic Fantasy)

2. **🎙️ Pick Your Voice**
   - Select from 5 different AI voices (Fenrir, Zephyr, Puck, Charon, Kore)

3. **📦 Prepare Your Code**
   - Zip your project folder (include all source files)
   - Recommended: Focus on key directories (src, components, services, etc.)

4. **📤 Upload**
   - Drag and drop your `.zip` file into the upload zone
   - Or click to browse and select

5. **⏳ Wait for Magic**
   - The app extracts your code
   - Gemini 3 Pro analyzes the structure
   - AI generates the script and metrics
   - Text-to-speech creates the audio

6. **🎧 Enjoy!**
   - Listen to your code being narrated
   - Watch the avatar react
   - View the audio visualizer
   - Check out your code metrics

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Smaller zips process faster** - Focus on core source files
- **Try different styles** for different perspectives on the same code
- **Mix and match** voices with styles for unique combinations
- **Share the audio** with your team for fun code reviews
